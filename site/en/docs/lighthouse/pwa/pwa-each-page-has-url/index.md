{% Aside 'caution' %}
PWA testing in Lighthouse is deprecated. For more information on its deprecation see [Chromeâ€™s updated Installability Criteria](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/update-install-criteria). For guidance on testing, refer to the [PWA documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/progressive-web-apps/).
{% endAside %}

Ensure individual pages and views in your
[Progressive Web App (PWA)](https://web.dev/explore/progressive-web-apps#make-it-installable)
are deep linkable via URL and that each URL is unique
to make them easily shareable on social media.

## Recommendations

- Test that individual pages and views can be opened and
  directly accessed via new browser windows.
- If building a single-page app,
  make sure the client-side router can reconstruct the app state from a given URL.
